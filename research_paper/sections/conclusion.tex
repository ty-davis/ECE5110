As chips become increasingly complicated, and accordingly the 
layout becomes increasingly complex, the methods for layout
and routing in VLSI design become progressively more difficult.
Decades of research and exploration have resulted in optimized
algorithms and methods for automating the design of VLSI chips.
As Moore's law becomes increasingly difficult to maintain,
as well as manufacturing processes getting increasingly difficult,
optimized routing and the decrease of interconnect wires will
be essential. Machine learning methods have proven effective
in case-studies and may be an extremely pivotal technology in
the future of VLSI design.
