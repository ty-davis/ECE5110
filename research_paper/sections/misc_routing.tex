There are other widely used techniques in 
routing and planning that can be utilized in VLSI design
that I felt deserved to be mentioned here.

River-routing is the concept of laying out the connections
between cells such that the paths don't have to cross, allowing
the lines to look like a parallel streams, or the illusion of a river.

X-routing and Y-routing is a similar technique where
you use two different metal layers in different directions.
For instance, a metal1 layer may be used East-West (on the x-axis)
while a metal2 layer is used from North-South (on the y-axis).
